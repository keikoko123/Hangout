你提供嘅scenario 係咁多層假設下嘅edge case

這只是一個幫助人類演化的過程
這更像只是一個選擇的問題1
而不是一個衝突

他們想要睇高innovation的solution 
而不是高性能solution

感謝大大無私分享, [1/12/2025 4:56 AM]
only if you suggest a solution better than mine
,  the solution is just showed you how it function in the working flow.
not a perfect solution is okay, otherwise edge case is not a big deal, you are not the target customer is also not a big deal, do you agree?

solution is not perfect, but acceptable.
i think the critical for promoting the application is the problem in the trend. 
because solution is not a big different to the apps competition in nowadays, such as every solution like youtube, but it cannot beat the youtube. but youtube is still not perfect to every edge case, i think it can fulfill around 90% cases?

youtube is a solution for video content
twitch is a solution for streaming content

even youtube have the streaming but it's solution is not a better than the solition of twitch
